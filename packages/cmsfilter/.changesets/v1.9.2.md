- Fixed `<select>` elements filtering items when they contained just a portion of the value instead of matching the entire word.
  For instance, a value like `Men` would filter items that contained the word `WoMEN`.
  Now all `<select>` inputs are treated like `checkboxes` and `radios`, their value must be an exact (case insensitive) match like `Men` = `Men` || `men`.
