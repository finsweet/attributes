- Added new `fs-cmsfilter-element="filter-results-count"` attribute.
  It can be placed in any Text element inside a `Checkbox Field` or `Radio Field`, and this element will display the amount of items that match that particular filter.
  The results count is dynamically updated every time a filter is applied, only showing the available items in the current filter query.
- Added new `fs-cmsfilter-hideempty="true"` attribute.
  It can be added to any `Checkbox` or `Radio`, specifically to the same element where the `fs-cmsfilter-field="IDENTIFIER"` attribute is added.
  When the current filter has no results in the list, the `Checkbox`/`Radio` element is hidden.
  Very useful to narrow down options to the users when other filters are applied.
- Internal refactorings / performance improvements.
