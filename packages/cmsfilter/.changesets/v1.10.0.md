Included a new `window.fsAttributes.push()` method in the developer API that provides a standarized way to safely access any Attribute internals once it has fully loaded.
It can be used like:

```html
<script>
  window.fsAttributes = window.fsAttributes || [];
  window.fsAttributes.push([
    'cmsfilter',
    (cmsFilters) => {
      console.log('Attribute has successfully loaded!');
      console.log(cmsFilters);
    },
  ]);
</script>
```
