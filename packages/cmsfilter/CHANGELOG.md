# @finsweet/attributes-cmsfilter

## 1.16.3

### Patch Changes

- 78affc6: fix: date normalization in different locales

## 1.16.2

### Patch Changes

- 02469177: Improved support for `cmsstatic`.

## 1.16.1

### Patch Changes

- 1cfbca90: Update examples data and use clear attribute value inplace of option-reset, reset will be used as a fallback, may be removed completely in future.

## 1.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 24fb1c75: Added support to use any regular element as a CMS element, essentially allowing users to do things like:

  - Filtering a list of static elements.
  - Sorting a list of static elements.
  - Creating Tabs from static elements.
  - Creating Slides from static elements.
  - etc...

  Users can now do this is by adding the following Attributes to any element:

  - `fs-cms-element="wrapper"`
  - `fs-cms-element="list"`
  - `fs-cms-element="item"`
  - `fs-cms-element="pagination-wrapper"`
  - `fs-cms-element="pagination-next"`
  - `fs-cms-element="pagination-previous"`
  - `fs-cms-element="page-count"`
  - `fs-cms-element="empty"`

  This essentially tells Attributes to not only look for the native Webflow elements (Collection List Wrapper, Collection List, etc...), but to also look for these Attributes.

  In order to make static systems work, users have to replicate the same exact structure of the Webflow native CMS. So for example, to create a static list, users have to define elements using the same architecture:

  ```
  |_ Collection List Wrapper (fs-cms-element="wrapper")
    |_ Collection List (fs-cms-element="list")
      |_ Collection List Item (fs-cms-element="item")
  ```

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- e4b3b680: Created new `window.fsAttributes.destroy()` method to support SPA environments.
  This new method allows users to destroy all Attributes instances, cleaning up event listeners, observers, states, global variables, etc.

  Websites that use a client-side router that simulates an SPA environment like [barba.js](https://barba.js.org/) or [Swup](https://swup.js.org/) can now properly init and destroy Attributes.
  After destroying, Attributes can be manually re-initted by calling `window.fsAttribute[ATTRIBUTE_KEY].init()`.

  Updated changesets system, now all updates will be correctly reflected in [the official updates page](https://www.finsweet.com/attributes/updates).

### Patch Changes

- e194809: Improved accessibility for when `fs-cmsfilter-element="reset"` is applied to a Radio button.
  Previously, only clicks on the `fs-cmsfilter-element="reset"` elements were supported, making Radio buttons not accessible when using them with the keyboard.
  Now the library will detect if `fs-cmsfilter-element="reset"` is being used on a Radio button and listen for `input` events too.

- Added [API docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@finsweet/attributes-cmsfilter).

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

Included a new `window.fsAttributes.push()` method in the developer API that provides a standarized way to safely access any Attribute internals once it has fully loaded.
It can be used like:

```html
<script>
  window.fsAttributes = window.fsAttributes || [];
  window.fsAttributes.push([
    'cmsfilter',
    (cmsFilters) => {
      console.log('Attribute has successfully loaded!');
      console.log(cmsFilters);
    },
  ]);
</script>
```

## 1.9.6

### Patch Changes

- Updated `examples.json` API to include to the Focused (keyboard) changes in the [Filters UI Kit Examples](https://webflow.com/website/Accessible-Form-Filter-Components).

## 1.9.5

### Patch Changes

- Fixed small issue in the new tags rendering logic (introduced in `v1.9.4`).

## 1.9.4

### Patch Changes

- Now checkboxes with `true`/`false` as the value will just output their category name in the Tags.
  For instance, a `true`/`false` checkbox setting a `featured` value would previously render the tags like:

  - Without `tagcategory`: The tag rendered `true`.
  - With `tagcategory`: The tag rendered `TAG_CATEGORY: true`. Example: `Featured: true`.

  Instead, now the output will be:

  - Without `tagcategory`: The tag will render `featured`.
  - With `tagcategory`: The tag will render `TAG_CATEGORY`. Example: `Featured`.

## 1.9.3

### Patch Changes

- Published [CMS Filter Components](https://cms-filter-components.webflow.io/) as examples in the `examples.json` API.
  These examples will be available to copy right from the Designer using the Finsweet Extension.

## 1.9.2

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `<select>` elements filtering items when they contained just a portion of the value instead of matching the entire word.
  For instance, a value like `Men` would filter items that contained the word `WoMEN`.
  Now all `<select>` inputs are treated like `checkboxes` and `radios`, their value must be an exact (case insensitive) match like `Men` = `Men` || `men`.

## 1.9.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `fs-cmsfilter-element="empty"` not being correctly displayed.
  This issue was introduced a few days ago with the new `fs-cmsfilter-element="initial"` attribute.
  Now the render cycles take into consideration all possible setups to correctly display the `list`, `empty` and `initial` elements.

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Added new `fs-cmsfilter-element="initial"` attribute.

  If added to any element on the page, that specific element will be displayed instead of the `list` whenever there are no active filters.
  Once the user activated any filter, the `initial` element will hide and the `list` will display.

  **Tip**: To prevent content flashes, the `Collection List Wrapper` can be set to `opacity: 0`.

## 1.8.2

### Patch Changes

- Added compatibility with the new `cmsload`'s support for Webflow's native pagination query params.
  Now users can safely use this feature in conjunction of filters query parameters.

## 1.8.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `fs-cmsfilter-active` CSS Class not being correctly applied to `Radio` elements that had a default `checked` status.

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- Added support to override the `fs-cmsfilter-highlightclass="HIGHLIGHT_CSS_CLASS"` attribute at the filter elements level.
  Now, the attribute can be used like:
  - If added to the `list` element, all highlighted elements will receive this Highlight CSS Class. If not defined, it defaults to `.fs-cmsfilter_highlight`
  - If added to a specific filter element (that has a `fs-cmsfilter-field` attribute), the Highlight CSS Class will be overriden and applied to the matching text in the filtered Collection Items.
- Added an extra check to make sure the `Tags` are visible when rendering them without the `animations` module being loaded yet.

## 1.7.3

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `fs-cmsfilter-tagformat="category"` not preserving the original format of the `IDENTIFIER` when rendering the tags.
  Now, the tags will show the category text using the exact same format of the identifier (unless the user overrides it with `fs-cmsfilter-tagcategory="OVERRIDE_TEXT"`).
  For example:
  - Using `fs-cmsfilter-tagformat="category"` + `fs-cmsfilter-field="color"` will render the tags as `color: SELECTED_VALUE`.
  - Using `fs-cmsfilter-tagformat="category"` + `fs-cmsfilter-field="Color"` will render the tags as `Color: SELECTED_VALUE`.

## 1.7.2

### Patch Changes

- Made sure that filters instances are not duplicated.
  In some use cases like using `cmscombine` + `cmsfilters`, users added the same exact attributes to all `cmscombine` lists, thus multiple instances were being created causing funky behaviors.

  **Note:** There are still potential situations where `cmscombine` can break builds if users apply duplicated attributes, so we should first educate them to only add attributes to the first `cmscombine` target `list`, not all of them.

## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- Assured that the `animations` module is fully loaded before the library starts filtering.
  This caused issues like `Collection Items` and `Tags` that were added on page load using query params to not be animated.

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Released `v1.7.0-beta` to NPM.
- Created `changesets.json` API.

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- Breaking change: renamed `fs-cmsfilter-debouncing` to `fs-cmsfilter-debounce`.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Added `fs-cmsfilter-debouncing="TIME_IN_MS"`.
  When used, allows users to modify the default `input` [debouncing](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/debounce-in-javascript-improve-your-applications-performance-5b01855e086).
  Defaults to `50`.

- Added `fs-cmsfilter-active="ACTIVE_CSS_CLASS"`.
  If specified, all Checkbox Field and Radio Button Field (the parent elements) will receive this class whenever the Checkbox/Radio is checked.
  Defaults to `.fs-cmsfilter_active`.

- Fixed `fs-cmsfilter-duration` being incorrectly applied.

## 1.5.4

### Patch Changes

- Improved accessibility by ensuring unique IDs on dynamically generated form elements in `Collection Lists`.

## 1.5.3

### Patch Changes

- Added support for initial state values on `Checkboxes`, `Radio` and `Select` elements.
  If any of these elements has a default value, on page load the filters will automatically:
  - Store the value.
  - Trigger a filter + render workflow.
  - Sync the tags, if required.
  - Sync the URL query params, if required.

## 1.5.2

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `examples.json` not being available on NPM.

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Added support to override default list animation duration when it was already set by other `cms` packages.
- Memoized `TagData.textNode` prop so the text node doesn't have to be queried every time a text update is required on a tag.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Added support for `cmscore` versioning.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Added a visibility tracker to Submit Buttons. If it's not visible (`display: none`), the list will auto-filter as if there was no Submit Button.
- Added a window `resize` observer to update the visibility status of the Submit Button.
- Switched tags from being rendered on `input` events to being rendered on during the filter rendering. This assures that, if a Submit Button exists and it's visible, the tags will only be updated when submitting the form.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated `cmscore` import.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Added `fs-cmsfilter-tagformat` override at the filters level + a new `fs-cmsfilter-tagcategory` attribute.
- Updated `cmscore` import.

## 1.2.0

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `undefined` errors when checking range validity in single range props.
- Fixed value checking when multiple non checkbox/radio elements exist in a filter key.
- Fixed `fs-cmsfilter-range` filtering issue when the `from` value was not specified.
- Fixed `fs-cmsfilter-range` values not being correctly set from the URL query params on page load.
- Added support for `fs-rangeslider` sync when setting values from query params on page load.
- Improved tags rendering when the filter is a `range`. Now it outputs a single tag with a `[FROM_VALUE, TO_VALUE]` format, replacing the `undefined` values with a double dash `--`.
- Exposed the `CMSFilters` instances at `window.fsAttributes.cms.filtersInstances`.

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Added support to parse numbers that contain symbols like `$` or `,`.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Added new `fs-cmsfilter-element="filter-results-count"` attribute.
  It can be placed in any Text element inside a `Checkbox Field` or `Radio Field`, and this element will display the amount of items that match that particular filter.
  The results count is dynamically updated every time a filter is applied, only showing the available items in the current filter query.
- Added new `fs-cmsfilter-hideempty="true"` attribute.
  It can be added to any `Checkbox` or `Radio`, specifically to the same element where the `fs-cmsfilter-field="IDENTIFIER"` attribute is added.
  When the current filter has no results in the list, the `Checkbox`/`Radio` element is hidden.
  Very useful to narrow down options to the users when other filters are applied.
- Internal refactorings / performance improvements.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Fixed list animation issue on `nestinitialitems` event when the list was initially filtered by query params.
- Updated `cmscore` import.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated `cmscore` import.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes
