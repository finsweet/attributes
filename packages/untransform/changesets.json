Webflow transforms the `Slides` to create the carousel effect. When untransforming all parents, this caused the Slides' position to be broken.\r\n  - Instead, now the library will move the `position: fixed` elements out of their stacking context and place them as a direct child of the `<body>` while the untransforming is active.\r\n  - Once deactivating the untransforming, the library will place back the `fixed` elements to their original location.\r\n- Updated the copy example as it was missing some attributes.\r\n"},{"version":"v1.1.0","date":"29 November 2021","markdown":"- Created `changesets.json` API.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.8","date":"25 October 2021","markdown":"- Added `initAttributes` call to make sure `window.fsAttributes` exists.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.7","date":"16 October 2021","markdown":"- Updated `examples.json`.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.6","date":"25 September 2021","markdown":"- Implemented the `generateSelectors` util.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.0","date":"25 September 2021","markdown":"- Created the attribute package.\n"}]
