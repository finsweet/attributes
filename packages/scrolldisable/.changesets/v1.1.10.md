- Added a [temporary fix](https://github.com/willmcpo/body-scroll-lock/issues/237#issuecomment-954804479) to prevent Safari on `iOS 15` from jumping to the top of the page.
  This temporary patch will be removed once [body-scroll-lock](https://github.com/willmcpo/body-scroll-lock) releases an official update that addresses this issue.
