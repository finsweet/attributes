Added support to use `cmsselect` + `cmsload` (all modes are supported) together.

Now when a user adds `cmsload` to the parent `Collection List` of a `fs-cmsselect-element="text-value"` element, `cmsselect` will populate the new options as soon they are loaded.

All `cmsload` modes are supported and will trigger adding all items as options.
For instance, if the `Collection List` uses `pagination` mode, all items will be added as `<select>` options even if the user doesn't click on the `Next` button.

Also, `cmsselect` will now make sure that the added options are unique and not repeated.
This means that now users can set the `fs-cmsselect-element="text-value"` to any `Collection List Item` inside a `cmsfilter` setup to populate a `<select>` dropdown in the filters form.
