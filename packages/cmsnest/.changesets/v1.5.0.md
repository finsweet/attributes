Added support to implement `cmsnest` recursively.
Now the users can nest any amount of `Collection Lists` inside an already nested `Collection Item`, without any limitations of nesting levels.

Although a caching system has also been implemented to improve performance, users should be careful when implementing huge deeply nested setups, as many network requests may be needed.
