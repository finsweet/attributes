## 1.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 87507d5: `Fix`: prevented `cmsnest` from crashing when the user has incorreclty set up a duplicated Collection List source inside the item's Template Page.
  Previously, the library tried to nest the same Collection under a single target for each source that was located in the Template Page.
  Now the library will detect this invalid setup and just populate a single instance of each Collection for each nest target.

## 1.6.2

### Patch Changes

- Selector for Collection List updated in schema.

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixed issue that caused an infinite loop when the user incorrectly added the `fs-cmsnest-collection` attribute to the `<a>` element that points to the Template Page.
  Now the library takes this into consideration and prevents setting `<a>` elements as nesting targets to avoid creating an infinite loop.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Added support wizard and publishing new schema version

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

Added support to implement `cmsnest` recursively.
Now the users can nest any amount of `Collection Lists` inside an already nested `Collection Item`, without any limitations of nesting levels.

Although a caching system has also been implemented to improve performance, users should be careful when implementing huge deeply nested setups, as many network requests may be needed.

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Removed duplicated init that caused Template Pages to be fetched two times instead of one.
  Sites with long nested lists should notice a performance improvement with this update.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

Included a new `window.fsAttributes.push()` method in the developer API that provides a standarized way to safely access any Attribute internals once it has fully loaded.
It can be used like:

```html
<script>
  window.fsAttributes = window.fsAttributes || [];
  window.fsAttributes.push([
    "cmsnest",
    cmsLists => {
      console.log("Attribute has successfully loaded!");
      console.log(cmsLists);
    }
  ]);
</script>
```
