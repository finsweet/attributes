# `rangeslider` Changelog

## [v1.0.0.beta-3] 13th November 2021

- Fixed `Handle.handleInputChange` issue.

## [v1.0.0.beta-2] 13th November 2021

- Switched `input` event listeners on Handles to `change` events to avoid collisions with other solutions like `cmsfilter`.

## [v1.0.0.beta-1] 13th November 2021

- Added two way binding with the `<input>` elements.
  Now any `input` event that is emitted from the elements will automatically update the value of the correspondent Handle.
