- Turned `touch` event listeners to `passive` to pass the [Use passive listeners to improve scrolling performance](https://web.dev/uses-passive-event-listeners/) performance Lighthouse test.
- Improved Accessibility by assuring that each `Handle` has an `aria-label` attribute.
  The value of `aria-label` will be the `name` of the `<input>` element.
  If the user has already set this attribute in the Designer, `rangeslider` won't override that value.
