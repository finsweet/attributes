- Added support for the range slider being initially hidden on page load. Now the library will recalculate the range slider's position whenever its visibility changes.
- Added new `fs-rangeslider-update` attribute: setting this attribute to the `wrapper` element, allows users to define when should the `<input>` elements' value be updated:

  - `fs-rangeslider-update="move"`: The value of the `<input>` elements will be update on every single move of a `handle`.
  - `fs-rangeslider-update="release"`: The value of the `<input>` elements will only be updated when the user releases the mouse/finger from the `handle`. This is very useful for use cases like `cmsfilter`, where we don't want to be constantly triggering a new filter cycle when the user is still moving the `handle`.
    On the other hand, the `display-value` elements will still be updated real-time.

  When not specified, defaults to `fs-rangeslider-update="move"`.
