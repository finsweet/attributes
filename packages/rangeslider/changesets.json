[{"version":"v1.5.0","date":"12 February 2022","markdown":"Included a new `window.fsAttributes.push()` method in the developer API that provides a standarized way to safely access any Attribute internals once it has fully loaded.\nIt can be used like:\n\n```html\n<script>\n  window.fsAttributes = window.fsAttributes || [];\n  window.fsAttributes.push([\n    'rangeslider',\n    (handleInstances) => {\n      console.log('Attribute has successfully loaded!');\n      console.log(handleInstances);\n    },\n  ]);\n</script>\n```\n"},{"version":"v1.5.0-beta.0","date":"24 January 2022","markdown":"- Internal: implemented `schema.json` and improvements in constants.\n"},{"version":"v1.4.0","date":"6 December 2021","markdown":"- Turned `touch` event listeners to `passive` to pass the [Use passive listeners to improve scrolling performance](https://web.dev/uses-passive-event-listeners/) performance Lighthouse test.\n- Improved Accessibility by assuring that each `Handle` has an `aria-label` attribute.\n  The value of `aria-label` will be the `name` of the `<input>` element.\n  If the user has already set this attribute in the Designer, `rangeslider` won't override that value.\n"},{"version":"v1.3.1","date":"29 November 2021","markdown":"- Added support for handling [Floating-Point precision issues](https://floating-point-gui.de/).\n- Fixed an infinite loop being sometimes triggered during the `handle` - `input` update cycles.\n"},{"version":"v1.3.0","date":"29 November 2021","markdown":"- Created `changesets.json` API.\n"},{"version":"v1.2.0","date":"28 November 2021","markdown":"- Released `v1.2.0-beta`.\n"},{"version":"v1.2.0-beta.0","date":"27 November 2021","markdown":"- Added support for the range slider being initially hidden on page load. Now the library will recalculate the range slider's position whenever its visibility changes.\n- Added new `fs-rangeslider-update` attribute: setting this attribute to the `wrapper` element, allows users to define when should the `<input>` elements' value be updated:\n\n  - `fs-rangeslider-update=\"move\"`: The value of the `<input>` elements will be update on every single move of a `handle`.\n  - `fs-rangeslider-update=\"release\"`: The value of the `<input>` elements will only be updated when the user releases the mouse/finger from the `handle`. This is very useful for use cases like `cmsfilter`, where we don't want to be constantly triggering a new filter cycle when the user is still moving the `handle`.\n    On the other hand, the `display-value` elements will still be updated real-time.\n\n  When not specified, defaults to `fs-rangeslider-update=\"move\"`.\n"},{"version":"v1.1.2","date":"15 November 2021","markdown":"- Reduced `resize` debouncing from 100ms to 50ms.\n"},{"version":"v1.1.1","date":"15 November 2021","markdown":"- Added `examples.json` to the package.\n"},{"version":"v1.1.0","date":"15 November 2021","markdown":"- Added new `fs-rangefilter-formatdisplay=\"true\"` attribute.\n  Now, by default all `fs-rangefilter-element=\"display-value\"` elements will display the numeric value without formatting.\n  If the `formatdisplay` attribute is added to the `wrapper` element, the `display-value` elements will display a formatted value (formatting defaults to the user's country conventions, some countries use commas and other countries use dots).\n- Added an extra check to make sure the Handles' start values are adjusted to the `step` increment coefficient.\n- Added an extra rule to set the Handles' start value to the `minRange` or `maxRange` if the provided value doesn't match the range. When this happens, a custom `Debug` message will be displayed to warn the user when using `debugMode`.\n- Added an extra `Debug` alert that warns the user when the provided `step` value doesn't fit the provided `[min,max]` range.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.1","date":"15 November 2021","markdown":"- Made sure the track is set to `position: relative` and the Handles & Fill have the correct `position: absolute` values.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.0","date":"15 November 2021","markdown":"- Released `v1.0.0-beta` features.\n- Added support to recalculate the range slider position on window `resize` events.\n- Removed dependency on `Emittery`, reduced the package size from 14KB to 9KB.\n- Internal refactoring and performance improvements.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.0-beta.8","date":"14 November 2021","markdown":"- Fixed values not being correctly calculated when the `min range` was set to a different value than 0.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.0-beta.7","date":"14 November 2021","markdown":"- Fixed `v1.0.0-beta.6` code not being included in the build.
