- Added support for using `Lightbox` elements inside `Collection List Items` when using `cmsload`.
  The script will now detect if any newly rendered item contains a `.w-lightbox` trigger and restart the Webflow `lightbox` module.
- Improved support for loading items when `E-Commerce` is enabled.
  Now the Webflow `commerce` module will only be restarted if if any newly rendered has an `Add To Cart` form.
