- Added new `fs-cmsload-element="page-count"`.
  When defined, this element will display the amount of items currently displayed on the screen.
  This is very useful in setups with `fs-cmsload-mode="load-under"`, as now users are able to display how many items have been loaded so far.
- Cleaned some old deprecated checks.
