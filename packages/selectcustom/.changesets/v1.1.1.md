- Fixed dropdowns not closing automatically after selecting an option on mobile.
- Fixed `fs-selectcustom-hideinitial` sometimes causing unwanted flashes when toggling the `option-reset` element's visibility.
- Added better support for using `Dropdown` interactions that affect how the `Dropdown List` is displayed/hidden.
