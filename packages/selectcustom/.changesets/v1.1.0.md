- Removed `fs-selectcustom-element="text"` and `fs-selectcustom-element="label-content"` attributes as they were unnecessary. Users should only have one Text element inside the option template.
- Made `fs-selectcustom-element="label"` optional. If not defined, the library will look for the first Text element occurrency inside the Dropdown Toggle.
- Added `fs-selectcustom-element="option-reset"` attribute. If added to an `<a>` element inside the Dropdown List, this element will be used as the template for the options with no value.
- Added `fs-selectcustom-hideinitial="true"` attribute. If added to the Dropdown (the element with `fs-selectcustom-element="dropdown"` attribute), the options with no value will be hidden when there are no currently selected options, and displayed otherwise.
