- Changed how the library works internally:
  - Previously, all parent elements of a `fs-untransform-element="fixed"` element were untransformed by applying a `transform: unset !important` style to them.
  - This caused some use cases to break the layouts, like when using this solution inside `Slider` components. Webflow transforms the `Slides` to create the carousel effect. When untransforming all parents, this caused the Slides' position to be broken.
  - Instead, now the library will move the `position: fixed` elements out of their stacking context and place them as a direct child of the `<body>` while the untransforming is active.
  - Once deactivating the untransforming, the library will place back the `fixed` elements to their original location.
- Updated the copy example as it was missing some attributes.
