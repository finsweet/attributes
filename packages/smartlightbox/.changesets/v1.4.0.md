- Renamed the package from `untransform` to `smartlightbox`. This implies that:

  - This update is published under a new NPM Package `@finsweet/attributes-smartlightbox`, and the previous `@finsweet/attributes-untransform` will be kept for backwards compatibility.
  - Users currently using the `untransform` package won't be affected by this update and their sites will continue working as expected.
  - If users want to receive any new updates of the package, they will have to switch to this new one. The old `untransform` package won't receive any more updates, but will be classified as [Long-term support (LTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support).

- Renamed attributes to accomodate the new package:

  - `fs-untransform-element="fixed"` => `fs-smartlightbox-element="lightbox"`
  - `fs-untransform-element="trigger-on"` => `fs-smartlightbox-element="trigger-open"`
  - `fs-untransform-element="trigger-off"` => `fs-smartlightbox-element="trigger-close"`
  - `fs-untransform-element="toggle"` => `fs-smartlightbox-element="trigger-toggle"`
  - `fs-untransform-timeout="TIMEOUT_VALUE"` => `fs-smartlightbox-wait="TIME_IN_MS"`

- Updated the copy/paste examples with the new attributes.
