This implies that:\n\n  - This update is published under a new NPM Package `@finsweet/attributes-smartlightbox`, and the previous `@finsweet/attributes-untransform` will be kept for backwards compatibility.\n  - Users currently using the `untransform` package won't be affected by this update and their sites will continue working as expected.\n  - If users want to receive any new updates of the package, they will have to switch to this new one. The old `untransform` package won't receive any more updates, but will be classified as [Long-term support (LTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support).\n\n- Renamed attributes to accomodate the new package:\n\n  - `fs-untransform-element=\"fixed\"` => `fs-smartlightbox-element=\"lightbox\"`\n  - `fs-untransform-element=\"trigger-on\"` => `fs-smartlightbox-element=\"trigger-open\"`\n  - `fs-untransform-element=\"trigger-off\"` => `fs-smartlightbox-element=\"trigger-close\"`\n  - `fs-untransform-element=\"toggle\"` => `fs-smartlightbox-element=\"trigger-toggle\"`\n  - `fs-untransform-timeout=\"TIMEOUT_VALUE\"` => `fs-smartlightbox-wait=\"TIME_IN_MS\"`\n\n- Updated the copy/paste examples with the new attributes.\n"},{"version":"v1.3.0-beta.0","date":"24 January 2022","markdown":"- Internal: implemented `schema.json` and improvements in constants.\n"},{"version":"v1.2.0","date":"15 December 2021","markdown":"- Released `v1.2.0-beta`.\n"},{"version":"v1.2.0-beta.0","date":"15 December 2021","markdown":"- Changed how the library works internally:\n  - Previously, all parent elements of a `fs-untransform-element=\"fixed\"` element were untransformed by applying a `transform: unset !important` style to them.\n  - This caused some use cases to break the layouts, like when using this solution inside `Slider` components. Webflow transforms the `Slides` to create the carousel effect. When untransforming all parents, this caused the Slides' position to be broken.\n  - Instead, now the library will move the `position: fixed` elements out of their stacking context and place them as a direct child of the `<body>` while the untransforming is active.\n  - Once deactivating the untransforming, the library will place back the `fixed` elements to their original location.\n- Updated the copy example as it was missing some attributes.\n"},{"version":"v1.1.0","date":"29 November 2021","markdown":"- Created `changesets.json` API.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.8","date":"25 October 2021","markdown":"- Added `initAttributes` call to make sure `window.fsAttributes` exists.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.7","date":"16 October 2021","markdown":"- Updated `examples.json`.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.6","date":"25 September 2021","markdown":"- Implemented the `generateSelectors` util.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.0","date":"25 September 2021","markdown":"- Created the attribute package.\n"}]
