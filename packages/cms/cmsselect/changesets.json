[{"version":"v1.4.0","date":"26 April 2022","markdown":"Added support to use `cmsselect` + `cmsload` (all modes are supported) together.\r\n\r\nNow when a user adds `cmsload` to the parent `Collection List` of a `fs-cmsselect-element=\"text-value\"` element, `cmsselect` will populate the new options as soon they are loaded.\r\n\r\nAll `cmsload` modes are supported and will trigger adding all items as options.\r\nFor instance, if the `Collection List` uses `pagination` mode, all items will be added as `<select>` options even if the user doesn't click on the `Next` button.\r\n\r\nAlso, `cmsselect` will now make sure that the added options are unique and not repeated.\r\nThis means that now users can set the `fs-cmsselect-element=\"text-value\"` to any `Collection List Item` inside a `cmsfilter` setup to populate a `<select>` dropdown in the filters form.\r\n"},{"version":"v1.3.0","date":"19 April 2022","markdown":"- Added support wizard and publishing new schema version\r\n"},{"version":"v1.2.0","date":"10 February 2022","markdown":"Included a new `window.fsAttributes.push()` method in the developer API that provides a standarized way to safely access any Attribute internals once it has fully loaded.\r\nIt can be used like:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  window.fsAttributes = window.fsAttributes || [];\r\n  window.fsAttributes.push([\r\n    'cmsselect',\r\n    (elements) => {\r\n      console.log('Attribute has successfully loaded!');\r\n      console.log(elements);\r\n    },\r\n  ]);\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n"},{"version":"v1.2.0-beta.0","date":"24 January 2022","markdown":"- Internal: implemented `schema.json` and improvements in constants.\r\n"},{"version":"v1.1.0","date":"29 November 2021","markdown":"- Created `changesets.json` API.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.4","date":"17 November 2021","markdown":"- Fixed `examples.json` not being available on NPM.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.3","date":"10 November 2021","markdown":"- Updated package description.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.2","date":"7 November 2021","markdown":"- Breaking change: renamed `fs-cmsselect-element=\"source\"` as `fs-cmsselect-element=\"text-value\"`.\n- Breaking change: renamed `fs-cmsselect-element=\"target\"` as `fs-cmsselect-element=\"select\"`.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.1","date":"25 October 2021","markdown":"- Added `initAttributes` call to make sure `window.fsAttributes` exists.\n"},{"version":"v1.0.0","date":"18 October 2021","markdown":"- Created the attribute package.\n"}]
