- Added support to override the `fs-cmsfilter-active="ACTIVE_CSS_CLASS"` attribute at the filter elements level.
  Now, the attribute can be used like:
  - If added to the `list` element, all filter elements will receive this Active CSS Class. If not defined, it defaults to `.fs-cmsfilter_active`
  - If added to a specific filter element (that has a `fs-cmsfilter-field` attribute), the Active CSS Class will be overriden.
- Added support to use `fs-cmsfilter-active="ACTIVE_CSS_CLASS"` on any type of form element, not just `Checkboxes` and `Radios`.
  The Active CSS Class will be added whenever the elements are filled with a value.
- Improved performance on `input` and `restart` events handling.
