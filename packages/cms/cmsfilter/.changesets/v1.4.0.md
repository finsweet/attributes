- Added a visibility tracker to Submit Buttons. If it's not visible (`display: none`), the list will auto-filter as if there was no Submit Button.
- Added a window `resize` observer to update the visibility status of the Submit Button.
- Switched tags from being rendered on `input` events to being rendered on during the filter rendering. This assures that, if a Submit Button exists and it's visible, the tags will only be updated when submitting the form.
