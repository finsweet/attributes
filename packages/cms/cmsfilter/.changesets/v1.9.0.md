- Added new `fs-cmsfilter-element="initial"` attribute.

  If added to any element on the page, that specific element will be displayed instead of the `list` whenever there are no active filters.
  Once the user activated any filter, the `initial` element will hide and the `list` will display.

  **Tip**: To prevent content flashes, the `Collection List Wrapper` can be set to `opacity: 0`.
