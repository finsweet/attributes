- Added support to override the `fs-cmsfilter-highlightclass="HIGHLIGHT_CSS_CLASS"` attribute at the filter elements level.
  Now, the attribute can be used like:
  - If added to the `list` element, all highlighted elements will receive this Highlight CSS Class. If not defined, it defaults to `.fs-cmsfilter_highlight`
  - If added to a specific filter element (that has a `fs-cmsfilter-field` attribute), the Highlight CSS Class will be overriden and applied to the matching text in the filtered Collection Items.
- Added an extra check to make sure the `Tags` are visible when rendering them without the `animations` module being loaded yet.
