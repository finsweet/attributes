- Made sure that filters instances are not duplicated.
  In some use cases like using `cmscombine` + `cmsfilters`, users added the same exact attributes to all `cmscombine` lists, thus multiple instances were being created causing funky behaviors.

  **Note:** There are still potential situations where `cmscombine` can break builds if users apply duplicated filters, so we should first educate them to only add attributes to the first `cmscombine` target `list`, not all of them.
