- Added support to use pagination query params.
  Now `cmscore` will extract each `CMSList` pages query (example: `5f7457b3_page`) to be able to consume it with other packages like `cmsload`.
  This has involved several internal changes:
  - Added new `storePaginationData` util. The method is `async` and while running it stores a Promise in `CMSList.extractingPaginationData`.
  - Added new `CMSList.originalItemsPerPage`, `CMSList.pagesQuery` and `CMSList.showPaginationQuery` props.
  - Now `CMSList.currentPage` will no longer be used as the reference to slice rendered items. Instead, a new `CMSList.paginationActive` is used as the reference.
  - Modified `CMSList.switchPage()` to define if it should trigger a rendering cycle.
  - Added new `CMSList.initPagination()` method.
  - Deprecated `CMSList.addPaginationPrevious()` in favor of a new `CMSList.addPaginationButton()` method.
- Refactored: Moved `CMSList.updateItemsCount()` to be an external util.
