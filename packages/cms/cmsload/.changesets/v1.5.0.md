- Added support to use Webflow's native pagination query params with `fs-cmsload-mode="pagination"`:
  - If a user loads a URL that contains a paginated query (example: `https://example.com/path?34ac1605_page=2`), the list will automatically switch to that page.
  - Supports multiple paginated lists on the same page. A query like `https://example.com/path?5f7457b3_page=2&a4c81382_page=2` is completely valid as long as all queried lists are using the `pagination` mode.
- Added new `fs-cmsload-showquery="true"` attribute.
  If applied to the `list` element, the URL in the navigation bar will be updated with the corresponding page parameters when switching pages.
  This attribute only works in conjunction with `fs-cmsload-mode="pagination"`.
- Improved UX and Accessibility by dynamically setting the correspondent page query to the `Previous`/`Next` buttons as well as all `page-button` elements.
  This way, users can right click on any pagination button and open that page in a new Tab, or copy the link to that specific page to share it with other people.
- Updated the `schema.json` API to include this new functionalities.
