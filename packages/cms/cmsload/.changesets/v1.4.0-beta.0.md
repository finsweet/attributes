- Implemented an important speed optimization when loading new items on the list.
  If users activate the native [Page Count](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/paginate-collection-lists#configure-pagination-settings) element (it can be set to `display: none`, no need to have it visible), `cmsload` will optimize the loading of the pages.
  Enabling this feature improves loading speed by `500%` on average.
- Added support to use `cmsfilter` + `load-under` or `infinite modes`.
- Improved `fs-cmsload-element="items-count"` when using `load-under` and `infinite` modes. Now the lists will always show the correct total amount of items, not just the loaded items so far.
