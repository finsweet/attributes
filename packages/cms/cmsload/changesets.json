[{"version":"v1.5.0","date":"8 December 2021","markdown":"- Added support to use Webflow's native pagination query params with `fs-cmsload-mode=\"pagination\"`:\n  - If a user loads a URL that contains a paginated query (example: `https://example.com/path?34ac1605_page=2`), the list will automatically switch to that page.\n  - Supports multiple paginated lists on the same page. A query like `https://example.com/path?5f7457b3_page=2&a4c81382_page=2` is completely valid as long as all queried lists are using the `pagination` mode.\n- Added new `fs-cmsload-showquery=\"true\"` attribute.\n  If applied to the `list` element, the URL in the navigation bar will be updated with the corresponding page parameters when switching pages.\n  This attribute only works in conjunction with `fs-cmsload-mode=\"pagination\"`.\n- Improved UX and Accessibility by dynamically setting the correspondent page query to the `Previous`/`Next` buttons as well as all `page-button` elements.\n  This way, users can right click on any pagination button and open that page in a new Tab, or copy the link to that specific page to share it with other people.\n- Updated the `schema.json` API to include this new functionalities.\n"},{"version":"v1.4.0","date":"2 December 2021","markdown":"- Released `v1.4.0-beta.0`.\n"},{"version":"v1.4.0-beta.0","date":"2 December 2021","markdown":"- Implemented an important speed optimization when loading new items on the list.\n  If users activate the native [Page Count](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/paginate-collection-lists#configure-pagination-settings) element (it can be set to `display: none`, no need to have it visible), `cmsload` will optimize the loading of the pages.\n  Enabling this feature improves loading speed by `100%` every 4 pages in total on average.\n- Improved support to use `cmsfilter` + `load-under` or `infinite` modes.\n- Improved `fs-cmsload-element=\"items-count\"` when using `load-under` and `infinite` modes.
