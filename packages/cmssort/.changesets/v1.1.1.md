- Added support for Alphanumeric sorting. Before, the following strings:

  - Project 0
  - Project 1
  - Project 2
  - Project 10
  - Project 11
  - Project 12
  - Project 20
  - Project 21
  - Project 22

  Were sorted like:

  - Project 0
  - Project 1
  - Project 10
  - Project 11
  - Project 12
  - Project 2
  - Project 20
  - Project 21
  - Project 22

  Now strings that contain both characters and numbers are analyzed and sorted correctly.
