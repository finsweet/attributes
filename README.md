# Attributes by Finsweet

Work in progress.

This is a monorepo containing all of the **Attributes** solutions.

This monorepo uses [npm Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) to manage all the packages, you will need to have `npm 7.x` or higher to be able to use them.
Please, make sure you know how to use `npm Workspaces` before performing any actions.

## How to start

`cd` into one of the packages.

Use `npm run dev` to build for development, you can define a custom build directory setting an `.env` file.

Use `npm run build` to build for production.
